1. **Flask app code (app.py):**

   This Python script defines a basic Flask application that serves as an API for managing a collection of data. The app provides several endpoints for different operations:

   - **Home route ('/'):** Returns a welcoming message.
   - **GET route ('/data'):** Retrieves all data in JSON format.
   - **GET route ('/data/<int:id>'):** Retrieves a specific item by its ID.
   - **POST route ('/data'):** Adds a new item to the data collection.

   The sample data is stored in a list of dictionaries within the script. Each dictionary represents an item with attributes like ID, name, city, and education. The Flask app utilizes the `Flask` class from the Flask module to create the web application. The routes are defined using the `@app.route` decorator, specifying the URL endpoint and the HTTP methods allowed for each endpoint. The application runs on the local server with debugging enabled.

2. **Post_request file (post_request.py):**

   This Python script sends a POST request to the Flask API defined in the `app.py` script. It utilizes the `requests` module to make HTTP requests. The script specifies the URL of the Flask API endpoint (`http://localhost:5000/data`) and prepares JSON data to be sent in the request body. The JSON data represents a new item to be added to the data collection, with attributes like ID, name, city, and education. The `requests.post()` method is used to send the POST request with the JSON data to the Flask API endpoint. Finally, the script prints the response from the API, which typically includes a message confirming the success of the operation.

   This script demonstrates how to interact with the Flask API by sending HTTP requests and receiving responses, specifically focusing on adding new data to the collection using a POST request.
